# Cypher Text Python Script

This script prompts the user for a file to decipher, generates a table of letter frequencies and then attempts to solve it by replacing most common encrypted characters with the most frequently used characters in english text.

## Getting Started

instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All you need is an up to date version of python 3 and a text encrypted through letter shuffling to try to crack.

### Installing

Download or clone the directory where you want it, place your encrypted text in the root directory and run the CypherText.py file, enter the name of your encrypted text and then it should print out a word frequency table and it will attempt to solve decrypt the text and output it to a new text file.
